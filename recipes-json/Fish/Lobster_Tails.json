    "lobster tails",
    "butter",
    "old bay seasoning"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Make sure that if the tails were frozen that they are thawed out--otherwise they are hard to cut and very cold!",
    "To cut, I cut them from the top down to the tail.",
    "Then, I use a spoon and pull the meat away from the inside of the shell.",
    "I place the meat on top of the shell, put on broiler pan.",
    "Heat oven to 425.",
    "Brush the tail with melted butter, sprinkle with Old Bay seasoning.",
    "Bake for 15 minutes, then broil for 6-8 minutes until the meat or shell turns light brown.",
    "Remove from oven, serve with melted butter.",
    "If you donâ€™t have Old Bay you can mix 1/4 t. salt, paprika with dash of pepper, cayenne pepper and allspice.",
    "Remember when you use the broiler, to have the oven door open a little."
