8 slices multi-grain bread8 slices canadian bacon8 poached eggs
1 t. canola oil1 c. diced sweet onion10 oz. thawed chopped spinach
1 lemon, zested juiced8 oz. light sour cream1/2 t. hot sauce1 t. salt
1/2 t. pepper1 T. cider vinegar
Using a big cookie cuter, cut a disk out of each slice of bread.  Set aside.  In  skillet heat oil 
over medium heat.  Add onions and sauté until translucent.  Add spinach, lemon zest and 
juice and continue cooking over medium heat for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and transfer 
mix to food processor.  Add sour cream and blend until creamy, add hot sauce and then 
season to taste with salt and pepper.  Fill a 12 inch skillet with 2 inches of water.  Add 
vinegar and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat until the bubbles just stop.  Crack each egg 
into the water and simmer until whites are set and opaque in color, 2-3 minutes.  While eggs 
poach, toast bread.  Cook bacon until warmed through.  Remove eggs from water and blot 
on towel to remove moisture.  To assemble lay 2 slices bacon on 2 toast rounds.  Top with 
1/4 of the spinach and finish with 2 eggs on top.  When I did this, I used English muffins and 
I did not use light sour cream because I have noticed that it tends to turn to water.
