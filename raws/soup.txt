Cook bacon until crisp, and chop into small pieces.  Cook unpeeled potato in boiling water 
and salt.  Drain, and cube if not already cubed.   Cook onion in bacon fat until clear.  Add 
clams and broth and simmer 5 minutes.  In 4 qt. pot melt butter.  Add flour and stir in 1 qt. 
milk and wine.  Cook over medium heat; stirring constantly until mix comes to a boil and 
thickens.  Reduce heat, add potato, clam, bacon and pepper.  Add remaining half and half 
and heat until hot.    I have made both of these versions and sometimes, I combine them 
into a mix of both.
