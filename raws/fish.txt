Shrimp and Pesto Calzones
1 10 oz. pkg. refrigerated pizza dough3 T. pesto6 oz. frozen, thawed small shrimp
3 thin tomato slices      3 oz. mozzarella cheese1 beaten egg white
Divide pizza dough into 3 pieces.  On a floured surface roll each piece of dough into a 6” 
circle. Spread 1 T. of the pesto atop half of each circle to within 1” of edges.  Top the pesto 
with 1/3 of the shrimp, 1 tomato slice, and 1/3 of the cheese leaving the other half of each 
circle and the edges uncovered.  Moisten edges of dough on each circle with egg white.  
Fold each in half; seal edges with the tines of a fork to prevent filling from oozing out while 
baking.  Prick tops once or twice; brush with remaining egg white.  Bake at 375 for 20-25 
minutes.

Live Lobsters
Store lobsters in the refrigerator until you are ready to use.   Before cooking I usually put 
them in cold water to clean them or you can rinse them.  Put some water in a pot with some 
vinegar.  When the water comes to a boil, put the lobsters in on a steamer basket.  It takes 
about 5 minutes per lobster, or cook until they are pinkish and no longer moving.

Lobster Tails
Make sure that if the tails were frozen that they are thawed out--otherwise they are hard to 
cut and very cold!  To cut, I cut them from the top down to the tail.  Then, I use a spoon and 
pull the meat away from the inside of the shell.  I place the meat on top of the shell, put on 
broiler pan.  Heat oven to 425.  Brush the tail with melted butter, sprinkle with Old Bay 
seasoning.  Bake for 15 minutes, then broil for 6-8 minutes until the meat or shell turns light 
brown.  Remove from oven, serve with melted butter.   If you don’t have Old Bay you can 
mix 1/4 t. salt, paprika with dash of pepper, cayenne pepper and allspice.  Remember 
when you use the broiler, to have the oven door open a little. 

Marinade for fish
I sometimes marinade fish or shrimp in zesty Italian dressing for several hours and then grill 
or bake the fish however you want.
