        <li>In mixing bowl combine pudding mix and 3 cups milk.</li>
      

        <li>Mix on low speed until all of the powdered mix disappears and the pudding just begins to thicken.</li>
      

        <li>Set aside.</li>
      

        <li>Reserve and refrigerate 1/2 cups raspberries for garnish.</li>
      

        <li>Place the remaining raspberries in a bowl and pour sugar over them.</li>
      

        <li>Crush with a spoon until you have a thick puree.</li>
      

        <li>Set aside.</li>
      

        <li>Separate each ladyfinger into 2 halves (they should already be split in half lengthwise but cut them yourself if necessary).</li>
      

        <li>Place 1/4 of the ladyfingers (12 halves) cut side up to line the bottom only of a trifle bowl with a 16 cups capacity.</li>
      

        <li>Spoon 1/4 of the raspberry mix over the ladyfingers and spread as evenly as possible, making sure that the puree meets the edges of the bowl.</li>
      

        <li>If some ladyfingers are not covered, drizzle milk over.</li>
      

        <li>Remove lid from Nutella jar and microwave on high for 15 seconds.</li>
      

        <li>Add nutella to bowl with pudding.</li>
      

        <li>Stir until well blended.</li>
      

        <li>Spread 1/4 mix on the raspberries.</li>
      

        <li>Spread 1/4 of the cool whip on pudding.</li>
      

        <li>Repeat the layers 3 more times in this order: ladyfingers, raspberries, pudding, cool whip.</li>
      

        <li>Be sure to end with cool whip and spread each layer all the way to the edges of the bowl.</li>
      

        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.</li>
      

        <li>Just before serving garnish with raspberries.</li>
      

        <li>You can also do this with strawberries and if your store doesnâ€™t have ladyfingers you could use thin slices of angel food cake or pound cake.</li>
