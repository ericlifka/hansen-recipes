          <li>In a bowl, combine the ground beef and pork with the fennel seeds, garlic, parsley, crushed red pepper flakes, Parmigiano, grill seasoning and Tbsp of olive oil.</li>
        

          <li>Mix all together well and make your burgers about 1” thick.</li>
        

          <li>Drizzle them with olive oil, cook on the grill about 6-8 minutes per side.</li>
        

          <li>Rachael made four burgers, but I used 1 lb. of both meats and made 9 burgers.</li>
        

          <li>Place a large sauté pan over medium high heat, add 2 Tbsp olive oil.</li>
        

          <li>Add the onions, and bell and Cubanelle peppers and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        

          <li>Cook stirring occasionally until the onions and peppers are tender, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
        

          <li>Split the rolls and toast briefly on the grill, until just marked.</li>
        

          <li>Place a patty on a roll, top with 2 slices of cheese and the onion pepper mix.</li>
        

          <li>I used 1 red, green, cubanelle, and onion.</li>
        

          <li>I also put the pepper mix on the bottom, topped with a burger, and then top with cheese.</li>
        

          <li>Dad and Steven liked these better than plain hamburgers.</li>
