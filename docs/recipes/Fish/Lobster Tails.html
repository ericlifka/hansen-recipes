    <ul>
      
        <li>Make sure that if the tails were frozen that they are thawed out--otherwise they are hard to cut and very cold!</li>
      

        <li>To cut, I cut them from the top down to the tail.</li>
      

        <li>Then, I use a spoon and pull the meat away from the inside of the shell.</li>
      

        <li>I place the meat on top of the shell, put on broiler pan.</li>
      

        <li>Heat oven to 425.</li>
      

        <li>Brush the tail with melted butter, sprinkle with Old Bay seasoning.</li>
      

        <li>Bake for 15 minutes, then broil for 6-8 minutes until the meat or shell turns light brown.</li>
      

        <li>Remove from oven, serve with melted butter.</li>
      

        <li>If you donâ€™t have Old Bay you can mix 1/4 tsp salt, paprika with dash of pepper, cayenne pepper and allspice.</li>
      

        <li>Remember when you use the broiler, to have the oven door open a little.</li>
