    <section class="ingredients">
      <ul>
        
          <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        

          <li>2 1/2 cups complete pancake mix, divided</li>
        

          <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
        

          <li>8 tsp hot sauce (Tabasco)</li>
        

          <li>1 1/4 lb. chicken tenders cut into small bite size pieces</li>
        

          <li>1 cups good quality blue cheese dressing (Marieâ€™s brand)</li>
        

          <li>2 green onions</li>
        

          <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
        
      </ul>

      <ol>
        
          <li>In a deep sided skillet heat 1 1/2 inches of vegetable oil over medium heat.</li>
        

          <li>If you wish to test the oil add a 1 inch cube of bread.</li>
        

          <li>If it turns deep golden brown in color in a count of 40 the oil is ready.</li>
        

          <li>While the oil is heating make the batter.</li>
        

          <li>In a wide mixing bowl combine 2 cups pancake mix 1 1/4 cups water and about 6 tsp hot sauce.</li>
        

          <li>Place the remaining 1/2 cups pancake mix in another wide mixing bowl.</li>
        

          <li>Arrange the batter and the bowl of plain pancake mix near the cook top and the heating oil.</li>
        

          <li>Line a plate with a few sheets of paper towels and keep within reach.</li>
        

          <li>Once the oil is heated and ready, toss the chicken pieces in 2 tsp of hot sauce and then toss in plain pancake mix, coat evenly and shake off excess.</li>
        

          <li>The plain dry pancake mix will help the batter stick to the chicken.</li>
        

          <li>Add some of the chicken to the batter.</li>
        

          <li>You are going to want to work in 3-4 batches coating and frying.</li>
        

          <li>Using a fork, toss the bites in the batter.</li>
        

          <li>Remove the first batch from the batter, shaking off excess as you carefully add them to the hot oil.</li>
        

          <li>Fry 2 minutes on one side or until deep golden brown, flip and continue to fry for another 2 minutes or until deep golden brown all over.</li>
        

          <li>Remove from the oil and drain on the paper towel lined plate, season with salt.</li>
        

          <li>Repeat until all the chicken is fried.</li>
        

          <li>Serve immediately with blue cheese dressing with green onions and black pepper stirred into it for dipping.</li>
        

          <li>Garnish platter with celery sticks.</li>
