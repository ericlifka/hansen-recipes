        <li>3/4 cups whole berry cranberry sauce (half can)</li>

    <ul>
      
        <li>Place the frozen meatballs in slow cooker.</li>
      

        <li>Make the gravy according to package directions, then add cranberry sauce, mustard and cream.</li>
      

        <li>Stir gently until well blended.</li>
      

        <li>Pour gravy mix over meatballs.</li>
      

        <li>Stir gently to make sure all the meatballs are coated with sauce.</li>
      

        <li>Cover and cook 4-5 hours on low or 2-3 hours on high.</li>
      

        <li>To serve you can use a slotted spoon to remove the meatballs and put in a serving dish, or have folks just do it out of the crockpot.</li>
      

        <li>There is another version I havenâ€™t made but had that is meatballs, 16 oz. jellied cranberry sauce and 12 oz. chili sauce.</li>
      

        <li>You can add 1 tsp cumin and 1/4 tsp cayenne if you like.</li>
      

        <li>This can also be used as a dinner served over rice or noodles.</li>
