Eggs Benedict Hollandaise Sauce

1/2 c. extra virgin olive oil
1 stick butter
2 egg yolks
1 T. cream
1 T. lemon juice
1/2 t. salt and pepper

Heat the oil and butter in a pan until the butter is melted.  
Put the egg yolks, cream, lemon juice, salt and pepper into a blender and blend for a few seconds at high speed until you have a smooth frothy mixture.  
Still at high speed, start pouring in the hot butter mix in a thin, steady stream, not too slowly.  
As you add the butter mix, the sauce should thicken.  
Continue pouring and blending until all the butter is used.  
Serve immediately or keep warm.  
To keep warm you can put it into a small thermos.
