Paula Deenâ€™s Taco Chili with Mix

Taco Chili mix:
1 c. dried kidney beans
1/2 c. dried pinto beans
1 pkg. taco mix
1 1 oz. pkg. buttermilk salad dressing mix
3 T. dried minced onion
1 t. chili powder
1/4 t. cumin
1 1/2 c. corn or tortilla chips
Taco Chili: 
1 packet taco chili mix
4 c. water
11 3/4 ox. can diced tomatoes and green chilies
16 oz. tomato sauce
1 lb. hamburger, cooked

Mix up taco chili mix.  
For chili Place beans in bowl cover with water and soak overnight.  
Drain. Add to pan with taco seasoning mix, water, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and hamburger.  
Boil, reduce to low and simmer for 2 hours until beans are tender.  
Serve with chips.   
I generally just skip the dried beans and use a can of kidney and pinto beans.
