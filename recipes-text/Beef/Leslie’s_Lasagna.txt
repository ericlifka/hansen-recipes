Leslieâ€™s Lasagna

1 1/2 lb. hamburger         
2 T. veggie oil
1 t. garlic powder
1 T. basil           
2 t. salt       
1 lb. stewed tomatoes
12 oz. tomato paste
8 oz. tomato sauce
1 t. oregano
2 eggs
1/2 t. pepper
onion
1 lb. ricotta and mozzarella cheese(Sliced)
8 oz. lasagna noodles
onion and garlic powder to your taste

Brown meat in veggie oil.
Spoon off fat.
Add garlic powder, basil, salt, stewed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, oregano and heat to simmering level.
Spoon some of the hot sauce and beat together with eggs.
Pour back into the sauce and add pepper and onion.
Simmer for 30 minutes.
Cook noodles.
Grease a cake pan.
Spoon in enough meat sauce to cover bottom.
Then put in layers of lasagna, ricotta, mozzarella and meat sauce until you run out of layers.
The last two layers should be noodles with meat sauce spooned into centers of each strip.
There is enough cheese for 2 layers.
Top entire thing with parmesan.
Bake uncovered at 350 for 30 minutes.
I make this and refrigerate and bring to room temp and then bake at 350 for 1 hour.
