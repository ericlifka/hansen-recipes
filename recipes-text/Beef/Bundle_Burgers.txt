Bundle Burgers

1 1/2 c. dressing
1/2 c. evaporated milk
1 can cr. of mushroom soup
1 1/2 lb. hamburger  
1 T. ketchup                 
2 t. Worcestershire

Prepare dressing (Stove top).
Add milk to meat and mix.
Roll out meat between waxed paper in 6 circles.
Put some dressing on top of circles.
Shape in balls around dressing.
Mix soup with ketchup and Worcestershire.
Put meat into casserole.
Top with soup mix.
Bake uncovered at  350 about 45-50 minutes.
I usually double the soup mix for that amount of meat for gravy to top potatoes.
