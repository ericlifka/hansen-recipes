Chocolate Hazelnut Trifle with Raspberries

2 (3.9 oz) pkgs. instant chocolate pudding mix
3 c. lowfat milk, plus a bit more for drizzling
5 c. fresh raspberries, divided 
1/2 c. sugar
24 ladyfingers (2 3 oz. packages)
13 oz. jar Nutella
12 oz. Cool Whip

In mixing bowl combine pudding mix and 3 c. milk.
Mix on low speed until all of the powdered mix disappears and the pudding just begins to thicken.
Set aside.
Reserve and refrigerate 1/2 c. raspberries for garnish.
Place the remaining raspberries in a bowl and pour sugar over them.
Crush with a spoon until you have a thick puree.
Set aside.
Separate each ladyfinger into 2 halves (they should already be split in half lengthwise but cut them yourself if necessary).
Place 1/4 of the ladyfingers (12 halves) cut side up to line the bottom only of a trifle bowl with a 16 c. capacity.
Spoon 1/4 of the raspberry mix over the ladyfingers and spread as evenly as possible, making sure that the puree meets the edges of the bowl.
If some ladyfingers are not covered, drizzle milk over.
Remove lid from Nutella jar and microwave on high for 15 seconds.
Add nutella to bowl with pudding.
Stir until well blended.
Spread 1/4 mix on the raspberries.
Spread 1/4 of the cool whip on pudding.
Repeat the layers 3 more times in this order: ladyfingers, raspberries, pudding, cool whip.
Be sure to end with cool whip and spread each layer all the way to the edges of the bowl.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.
Just before serving garnish with raspberries.
You can also do this with strawberries and if your store doesnâ€™t have ladyfingers you could use thin slices of angel food cake or pound cake.
