Bananas Foster

1 qt. vanilla ice cream
2/3 c. brown sugar   
1/4 c. butter          
2 T. milk
1/4 t. cinnamon        
3 c. sliced bananas (4 medium)
1/4 c. light rum

Scoop ice cream into 6 balls.
Place in dishes and freeze.
In 1 1/2 qt. casserole combine brown sugar, butter, milk and cinnamon.
Place in microwave.
Cook brown sugar mix at high for 1 1/2 minutes until butter melts and mix is bubbly, stirring once.
Add banana and cook on high 2 minutes until bananas are warm, stirring once.
In glass measure place rum.
Cook on high 20 seconds, pour over banana mix.
Ignite rum immediately with a long match.
Spoon sauce over ice cream.
Serve immediately.
I usually scoop the ice cream while the banana stuff is in the microwave.
