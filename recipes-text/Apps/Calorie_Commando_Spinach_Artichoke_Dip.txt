Calorie Commando Spinach Artichoke Dip

1 box frozen spinach, thawed
1 c. sour cream
1/2 c. Parmesan
1 c. mozzarella
8 oz. reduced fat cream cheese, softened
4 garlic cloves
1/2 t. pepper
1 t. hot pepper sauce
14 oz. can artichoke hearts

Heat oven to 350.  
Squeeze liquid from spinach, place in food processor with sour cream, Parmesan, 1/2 c. mozzarella, garlic, pepper and hot sauce.   
Process until blended.  
Place in 1 qt. baking dish, top with remaining mozzarella, and artichokes.  
Bake 30 min.  
I used half a box of spinach, but you could probably skip it if you donâ€™t  like spinach.  
Just mix all the other ingredients together and bake, you can probably skip the food processor.
