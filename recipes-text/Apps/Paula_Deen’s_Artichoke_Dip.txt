Paula Deen’s Artichoke Dip

2 cans artichoke hearts
1 pkg. spinach, thawed and squeezed
1/2 c. mayo
1/2 c. sour cream
1 c. Parmesan
Pepper jack cheese (about 1/2-1 c.)

Pulse the hearts in food processor.  
Add rest of ingredients and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  
I generally use 1 can of hearts and half a pkg. of spinach since some of you don’t like spinach much.  
I also tend to use 3/4 c. parmesan and 1 c. pepper jack.
