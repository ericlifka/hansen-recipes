Pizza Sandwiches

8 slices Italian bread
8 slices mozzarella cheese
8 slices tomato
4 t. Parmesan
1/4 t. garlic salt
24 slices pepperoni    
1/4 c. softened butter

On four slices of bread, layer one slice of mozzarella, two slices of tomato, 1 t. Parmesan cheese, dash of garlic salt and six slices pepperoni.
Top with remaining mozzarella and bread.
Spread outside of sandwiches with butter.
On a hot griddle, toast sandwiches for 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown.
Serve with pizza sauce.
I spread some pizza sauce on one side of the bread before putting the cheese on.
