Wild Rice Casserole

1 c. wild rice
2 c. water
1 c. celery diced
olive oil
1 envelope onion soup      
1 can Cream of Mushroom soup    
1 bullion cube (I use Knox)
1 c. water    
2 T. Worchester sauce


Add wild rice and water to pan and cook until tender, about an hour.
Saute celery in 2-3 tablespoons of Olive Oil until tender.
Add Onion soup, cream of mushroom soup, bullion cube, 1 c. water, and worchester sauce.
Add rice to mixture.  
Right before baking Saute 1 package of fresh mushrooms, in a little oil (or butter) and add to casserole.  
Bake at 350 for an hour.  
This gets better when it sits.
