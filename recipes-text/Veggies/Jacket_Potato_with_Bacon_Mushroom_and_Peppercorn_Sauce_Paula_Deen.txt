Jacket Potato with Bacon, Mushroom and Peppercorn Sauce (Paula Deen)

4 medium baking potatoes, well scrubbed
12 oz. bacon, chopped
8 oz. button mushrooms
1/4 c. brandy
1 T. green peppercorns drenched in cold water
1 c. cream
salt and pepper
butter, for topping

Preheat over to 375.
Prick potatoes with fork and bake until soft, about 1 hour.
Sauce:  
Sauté bacon, add button mushrooms and cook until golden brown.
Pour brandy in measuring cup and then into the pan and carefully ignite with a long match.
After the alcohol burns off and the flame has died, stir in the peppercorns.
Stir in the cream and heat through without boiling.
Salt and pepper to taste.
Cut open potatoes.
Top each with a bit of butter, then cover generously with sauce.
I believe that I omitted the peppercorns and didn’t use as much bacon.
