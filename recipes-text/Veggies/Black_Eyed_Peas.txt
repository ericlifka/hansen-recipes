Black Eyed Peas

1 T. veggie oil
1 c. onion
1/2 c. celery and carrot
2 bay leaves
1 t. salt
1/2 t. pepper
1/2 lb. dried black eyed peas
1 ham hock
2 1/2 c. water

Heat oil in large pot.
Add onion, celery, carrot.
Saut√© 3-4 minutes until veggies are tender.
Set aside.
Put peas, ham hock, bay leaves, salt, pepper and water and bring to a boil.
Reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally 1- 1/2 hours or until peas are tender.

You can add all of the stuff together at once and do it, but the veggies tend to fall apart.
You can also not cook the onion, celery and carrot and just add.
