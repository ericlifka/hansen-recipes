Buffalo Popcorn Chicken Bites (Rachael Ray)
vegetable oil for frying 2 1/2 c. complete pancake mix, divided 1 1/4 c. water
8 t. hot sauce (Tabasco) 1 1/4 lb. chicken tenders cut into small bite size pieces 1c.goodqualitybluecheesedressing(Marie’sbrand) 2greenonions1t.pepper
In a deep sided skillet heat 1 1/2 inches of vegetable oil over medium heat. If you wish to test the oil add a 1 inch cube of bread. If it turns deep golden brown in color in a count of 40 the oil is ready. While the oil is heating make the batter. In a wide mixing bowl combine 2 c. pancake mix 1 1/4 c. water and about 6 t. hot sauce. Place the remaining 1/2 c. pancake mix in another wide mixing bowl. Arrange the batter and the bowl of plain pancake mix near the cook top and the heating oil. Line a plate with a few sheets of paper towels and keep within reach. Once the oil is heated and ready, toss the chicken pieces in 2 t. of hot sauce and then toss in plain pancake mix, coat evenly and shake off excess. The plain dry pancake mix will help the batter stick to the chicken. Add some of the chicken to the batter. You are going to want to work in 3-4 batches coating and frying. Using a fork, toss the bites in the batter. Remove the first batch from the batter, shaking off excess as you carefully add them to the hot oil. Fry 2 minutes on one side or until deep golden brown, flip and continue to fry for another 2 minutes or until deep golden brown all over. Remove from the oil and drain on the paper towel lined plate, season with salt. Repeat until all the chicken is fried. Serve immediately with blue cheese dressing with green onions and black pepper stirred into it for dipping. Garnish platter with celery sticks.

4 mushrooms, sliced 1/2-3/4 c. 1 T. butter 6 oz. deli roasted turkey breast salt pepper 1/4 c. white cheddar dipping sauce--1/2 c. heavy cream, 1-2 oz. cheddar, 1 T. butter 7” baguette, sliced open 2 oz. Swiss cheese
For the sauce combine cream, cheese, and butter in small pan over medium heat and bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. The sauce should thicken. If you don’t want to go through the effort, just buy a can of Campbell’s cheddar cheese soup and heat up. Heat oven to 450. Sauté the mushroom slices in the butter and season with salt and pepper. Heat the breast in the microwave until warm. Cut the baguette so that with the top off it looks like a “v” but do not cut all the way through. Inside the v Spread some of the cheese sauce, turkey breast more cheese sauce, mushrooms. Bake the sandwich for 4 minutes. Put Swiss or provolone on top and bake 2 minutes more until the cheese melts. Put top on and slice in half for eating. I generally just use sub buns.

Ruby Tuesday Sonora Chicken Pasta
1 lb. velveeta or 1 16 oz. jar cheese whiz 1/2 c. heavy cream 2 T. minced red chili pepper 4 T. green chili pepper, minced 4 T. onion 1 garlic 2 t. olive oil 2 T. water
1/2 t. salt 2 t. sugar dash paprika
1/2 T. vinegar1/4 t. cumin 16 oz. penne pasta
4 chicken breast halves 1 15 oz. can black beans, undrained
2 Roma tomatoes
Preheat your stovetop grill. Combine the cheese with the cream in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often until it melts and is smooth. Sauté the red chili peppers and 2 T. green chili pepper, 2 T. onion and 1/2 clove garlic in olive oil for a couple minutes then add the water to the pan so that the peppers don’t scorch. Simmer another 2 minutes or until water has cooked off. When the cheese is smooth, add peppers, 1/4 t. salt, sugar, vinegar, and cumin. Leave on low heat, stirring occasionally until other ingredients are ready. Pour can of beans with liquid into small pan over medium heat. Add remaining green chili pepper, onions, garlic, pinch salt, dash paprika. Bring beans to a boil, stirring often, then simmer until everything else is ready. By this time the beans will have thickened and the onions will be transparent. Rub breasts with oil and salt and pepper. Cook on grill for 5 minutes per side or until done. When done, slice each breast into slices. As the chicken cooks prepare the pasta. Cook 12-14 minutes or until tender. Drain. When all is ready spoon pasta onto each plate, pour some cheese sauce over, add sliced breast, top with 1/3 c. black beans, sprinkle 1/4 c. tomato and some green onions over. I have revised this as it’s too putsy for serving. I slice the chicken into cubes and cook and add to the cheese mix. I add the cooked beans to the cheese and add the tomato. I just let folks dish their own pasta/sauce.
Chow Mein
Boil chicken meat in water (about a half pan of water). When chicken is done remove from pan. When cool, take meat off bones. Refrigerate chicken until needed. I usually do this the day before so that I can refrigerate the broth and remove the hardened fat the next day. Heat chicken stock. Add 1-2 onions, celery and cook for 10 minutes after boiling. Add water chestnuts, mushrooms with liquid. Can also add bean sprouts. Thickening: mix 1 c. cornstarch, 1 T. sugar, water, soy sauce. Mix to get smooth, then add more soy sauce if needed so that the color is slightly darker than a lunch bag. Slowly add to stock and stir, I usually add 1/2 - 3/4 of entire thickening. Stir, and boil a few minutes, add more thickening if necessary. Turn off and let season or add chicken and stir, serve. I usually let it season for a while then reheat and add chicken and serve. Grandma uses LaChoy soy sauce.

Shrimp and Pesto Calzones
1 10 oz. pkg. refrigerated pizza dough 3 T. pesto 6 oz. frozen, thawed small shrimp 3 thin tomato slices 3 oz. mozzarella cheese 1 beaten egg white

Fold each in half; seal edges with the tines of a fork to prevent filling from oozing out while baking. Prick tops once or twice; brush with remaining egg white. Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes.
Live Lobsters
Store lobsters in the refrigerator until you are ready to use. Before cooking I usually put them in cold water to clean them or you can rinse them. Put some water in a pot with some vinegar. When the water comes to a boil, put the lobsters in on a steamer basket. It takes about 5 minutes per lobster, or cook until they are pinkish and no longer moving.
Lobster Tails
Make sure that if the tails were frozen that they are thawed out--otherwise they are hard to cut and very cold! To cut, I cut them from the top down to the tail. Then, I use a spoon and pull the meat away from the inside of the shell. I place the meat on top of the shell, put on broiler pan. Heat oven to 425. Brush the tail with melted butter, sprinkle with Old Bay seasoning. Bake for 15 minutes, then broil for 6-8 minutes until the meat or shell turns light brown. Remove from oven, serve with melted butter. If you don’t have Old Bay you can mix 1/4 t. salt, paprika with dash of pepper, cayenne pepper and allspice. Remember when you use the broiler, to have the oven door open a little.
Marinade for fish
I sometimes marinade fish or shrimp in zesty Italian dressing for several hours and then grill or bake the fish however you want.
