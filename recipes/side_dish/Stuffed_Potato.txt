Stuffed Potato
Bake potato.  Cool about 15-30 minutes.  At this point you can either cut them in half 
lengthwise or cut out an oval hole on the top of each potato.  After this, scoop out the 
potato leaving some potato where the skin is.  Put the potato stuff in a bowl and mash with 
a little bit of butter and milk, until it is like mashed potato.  Add sour cream (the amount 
depends on how many potatoes you have) cheese, and green onions or chives.  Reheat 
in oven about 15 minutes or microwave.
