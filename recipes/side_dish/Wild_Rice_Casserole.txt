Wild Rice Casserole
Cook at least one cup wild rice (This will give you about 2 cups or 2 and 1/2 rice)
until tender about an hour.  Chop one cup celery and sauté in 2-3 tablespoons of Olive Oil
Add:
1 envelope onion soup      1 can Cream of Mushroom soup    1 bullion cube (I use Knox)
1  cup water    about 2 tablespoons Worchester sauce    (You really don't need salt and 
pepper, I don't add)
Add rice to mixture.  Right before baking    Saute 1 package of fresh mushrooms, in a little 
oil (or butter) and add to casserole.  Bake at 350 for an hour.  This gets better when it sits.
