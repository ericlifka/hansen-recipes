Rosettes (Aunt Ruth)

1 egg
1 c. milk
1/2 T. sugar
1 c. sifted flour
1/4 c. beer

Beat together all ingredients.
Let stand 1 hour so all bubbles are out of batter and so enough batter sticks on iron.
If it doesnâ€™t stand long enough they are real thin and holey.Lower iron into batter.
Cook rosettes about 1 minute.
Remove rosette with a fork and drain on paper towels.
Cool, dip in powdered sugar.
Always remember to reheat iron and drain on paper towel before dipping it into batter or rosette will refuse to stay on iron.
