Rosettes (Aunt Ruth)
1 egg1 c. milk1/2 T. sugar1 c. sifted flour1/4 c. beer
Beat together all ingredients.  Let stand 1 hour so all bubbles are out of batter and so 
enough batter sticks on iron.  If it doesnâ€™t stand long enough they are real thin and holey.
Lower iron into batter.  Cook rosettes about 1 minute.  Remove rosette with a fork and drain 
on paper towels.  Cool, dip in powdered sugar.  Always remember to reheat iron and drain 
on paper towel before dipping it into batter or rosette will refuse to stay on iron.
