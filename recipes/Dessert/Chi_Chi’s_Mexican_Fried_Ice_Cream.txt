Chi Chiâ€™s Mexican Fried Ice Cream

tortillas
1/2 t. cinnamon
2 T. sugar
1/2 c. oil
2 maraschino cherries
1/4 c. cornflakes (crushed)
2 large scoops vanilla ice cream
1 can whipped cream

Fry each tortilla in hot oil in a frying pan over medium high heat one minute per side.
Combine cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl.
Sprinkle half of this over the tortillas.
Combine the rest of the cinnamon with the cornflakes.
Put mix on a plate. Roll the ice cream scoop into a ball and roll in the cornflakes.
Place on the tortilla and spray whipped cream around the base of the ice cream, on the top of the ice cream and then top with a cherry.
You can do the ice cream in advance, but keep in the freezer until ready.
For more than 2, you will have to increase the amount of cornflakes, etc.
