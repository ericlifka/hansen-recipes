Pumpkin Pie (Libbyâ€™s on can label)

3/4 c. sugar
1/2 t. salt
1 t. cinnamon   
1/2 t. ginger 
1/4 t. cloves       
2 eggs
1 15 oz. can pumpkin
12 oz. evaporated milk
1 deep dish pie shell

Mix sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger and cloves in small  bowl.
Beat eggs in and add pumpkin.
Gradually add milk.
Pour into pie shell.
Bake at 425 for 15 minutes.
Reduce temperature to 350, bake for 40-50 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.
Cool for 2 hours.
Top with whipped cream.
You can use 1 3/4 t. pumpkin pie spice in place of cinnamon, ginger and cloves, but it will taste slightly different.
Also, I generally add more cinnamon than 1 t.
