Rhubarb Crumble

6 c. rhubarb sliced 1/2‚Äù thick
1/4 c. honey
1/3 c. oatmeal and flour
PAM
1/4 c. packed brown sugar
3 T. butter cut into small pieces

Combine rhubarb and honey together in bowl, toss to coat.
I added a little more honey to this.
Spray pan with PAM and add rhubarb.
In food processor put oats, flour and brown sugar.
Pulse a couple of times to mix.
Add butter and process until it resembles coarse meal.
Sprinkle mix over rhubarb.
Bake at 375 for 40 minutes or until rhubarb is tender.
I think I doubled the topping since we like alot of topping.
