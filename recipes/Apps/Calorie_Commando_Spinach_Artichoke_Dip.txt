Calorie Commando Spinach Artichoke Dip
1 box frozen spinach, thawed1 c. sour cream1/2 c. Parmesan
1 c. mozzarella8 oz. reduced fat cream cheese, softened4 garlic cloves
1/2 t. pepper1 t. hot pepper sauce14 oz. can artichoke hearts
Heat oven to 350.  Squeeze liquid from spinach, place in food processor with sour cream, 
Parmesan, 1/2 c. mozzarella, garlic, pepper and hot sauce.   Process until blended.  Place in 
1 qt. baking dish, top with remaining mozzarella, and artichokes.  Bake 30 min.  I used half a 
box of spinach, but you could probably skip it if you don’t  like spinach.  Just mix all the 
other ingredients together and bake, you can probably skip the food processor.
