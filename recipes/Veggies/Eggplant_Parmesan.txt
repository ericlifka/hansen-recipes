Preheat oven to 400.  Coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.  Coat an 8 x 11 1/2 inch 
baking dish with PAM.  To prepare eggplant:  Cut eggplants crosswise into 1/4‚Äù thick 
slices.  Whisk egg whites with water in a shallow dish until frothy.  Combine bread crumbs, 
1/4 c. Parmesan, salt and pepper in another shallow dish.  Dip the eggplant slices into the 
egg whites and then coat with the bread crumb mix.  Arrange the eggplant slices in a single 
layer on the baking sheets.  Bake for 15 minutes, turn them over and bake until crisp and 
golden about 15 minutes more.  To assemble casserole:  Stir basil into tomato sauce.  
Spread about 1/2 c. of the sauce in the prepared baking dish.  Arrange half the eggplant 
slices over the sauce, overlapping slightly.  Spoon 1 c. of the remaining sauce over the 
eggplant and sprinkle with half the mozzarella.  Layer on the remaining eggplant and top 
with the remaining sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan.  Bake the casserole, at 400 
uncovered, until the sauce bubbles and the top is golden, 15 to 25 minutes.
