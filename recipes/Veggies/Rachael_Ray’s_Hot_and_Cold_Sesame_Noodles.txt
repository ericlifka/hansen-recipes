Rachael Rayâ€™s Hot and Cold Sesame Noodles

1/2 lb. spaghetti
1/4 c. Tamari dark soy
1/4 c. smooth peanut butter, microwaved for 15 seconds until soft
2 T. cider or rice wine vinegar
1 T. dark sesame oil
1-2 T. hot sauce
2 c. shredded cabbage and carrot mix
1 c. bean sprouts
3 green onions
2 T. sesame seeds

Cook pasta to al dente, with a bite to it, then shock it to stop the cooking process by running it under cold water in colander.
Drain the pasta well.
In the bottom of a large bowl, whisk together soy, peanut butter, vinegar, oil, sesame oil, and hot sauce.
Add noodles and veggies and toss to combine the noodles and coat them evenly with sauce.
Sprinkle green onions and sesame seeds throughout and serve.
