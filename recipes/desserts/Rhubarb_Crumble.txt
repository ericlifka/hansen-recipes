Rhubarb Crumble
6 c. rhubarb sliced 1/2‚Äù thick1/4 c. honey1/3 c. oatmeal and flourPAM
1/4 c. packed brown sugar3 T. butter cut into small pieces
Combine rhubarb and honey together in bowl, toss to coat.  I added a little more honey to 
this.  Spray pan with PAM and add rhubarb. In food processor put oats, flour and brown 
sugar.  Pulse a couple of times to mix.  Add butter and process until it resembles coarse 
meal.  Sprinkle mix over rhubarb.  Bake at 375 for 40 minutes or until rhubarb is tender.  I 
think I doubled the topping since we like alot of topping.
