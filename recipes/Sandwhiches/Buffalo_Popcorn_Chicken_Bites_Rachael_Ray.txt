Buffalo Popcorn Chicken Bites (Rachael Ray)
vegetable oil for frying2 1/2 c. complete pancake mix, divided1 1/4 c. water
8 t. hot sauce (Tabasco)1 1/4 lb. chicken tenders cut into small bite size pieces
1 c. good quality blue cheese dressing (Marieâ€™s brand)2 green onions 1 t. pepper
In a deep sided skillet heat 1 1/2 inches of vegetable oil over medium heat.  If you wish to 
test the oil add a 1 inch cube of bread.  If it turns deep golden brown in color in a count of 40 
the oil is ready.  While the oil is heating make the batter.  In a wide mixing bowl combine 2 
c. pancake mix 1 1/4 c. water and about 6 t. hot sauce.  Place the remaining 1/2 c. pancake 
mix in another wide mixing bowl.  Arrange the batter and the bowl of plain pancake mix 
near the cook top and the heating oil.  Line a plate with a few sheets of paper towels and 
keep within reach.  Once the oil is heated and ready, toss the chicken pieces in 2 t. of hot 
sauce and then toss in plain pancake mix, coat evenly and shake off excess.  The plain dry 
pancake mix will help the batter stick to the chicken.  Add some of the chicken to the batter.  
You are going to want to work in 3-4 batches coating and frying.  Using a fork, toss the bites 
in the batter.  Remove the first batch from the batter, shaking off excess as you carefully 
add them to the hot oil.  Fry 2 minutes on one side or until deep golden brown, flip and 
continue to fry for another 2 minutes or until deep golden brown all over.  Remove from the 
oil and drain on the paper towel lined plate, season with salt.  Repeat until all the chicken is 
fried.  Serve immediately with blue cheese dressing with green onions and black pepper 
stirred into it for dipping.  Garnish platter with celery sticks.
