Planet Hollywood Chicken Crunch
Vegetable oil for frying2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (or tenders)
2 c. Capt. Crunch cereal1/2 c. corn flake crumbs1/2 t. onion powder
1/2 t. garlic powder1/2 t. salt1/4 t. pepper1 beaten egg1 c. milk
Preheat oil to 350.  I do it in the deep fryer at 350 for 4 min. 30 sec.    I use tenders, but if 
you use breast halves, cut them into strips.  Smash cracker crumbs.  Combine cereals, and 
spices.  Mix egg with milk.  Dredge chicken in milk, then coat with the cereal mix.  Do this to 
all your tenders.  Fry.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve with Creole mustard Sauce.
Creole Mustard Sauce:2 T. Grey Poupon Dijon mustard3 T. mayo
1 t. mustard1 t. cream style horseradish1 t. honey.  Mix together.
