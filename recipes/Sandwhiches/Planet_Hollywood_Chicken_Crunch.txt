Planet Hollywood Chicken Crunch

Vegetable oil for frying
2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (or tenders)
2 c. Capt. Crunch cereal
1/2 c. corn flake crumbs
1/2 t. onion powder
1/2 t. garlic powder
1/2 t. salt
1/4 t. pepper
1 beaten egg
1 c. milk
Creole Mustard Sauce:
2 T. Grey Poupon Dijon mustar
3 T. mayo
1 t. mustard
1 t. cream style horseradish
1 t. honey

Preheat oil to 350.
I do it in the deep fryer at 350 for 4 min. 30 sec.
I use tenders, but if you use breast halves, cut them into strips.
Smash cracker crumbs.
Combine cereals, and spices.
Mix egg with milk.
Dredge chicken in milk, then coat with the cereal mix.
Do this to all your tenders.
Fry.
Drain on paper towels.
Serve with Creole mustard Sauce.
