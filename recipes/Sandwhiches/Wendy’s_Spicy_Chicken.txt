Wendy’s Spicy Chicken

1/3 c. Frank’s red hot sauce mixed with 2/3 c. water
1 c. flour
2 1/2 t. salt
3 t. cayenne (or more)
1/2 t. garlic powder
1/2 t. paprika
1 t. pepper and onion powder
Buns
breast fillets
mayo
lettuce
tomato

I take a breast and beat to about 1/4-1/2” thickness.  
I cut each breast to a size that will fit a bun.  
Coat breast in flour + seasonings blend, then pepper sauce, then in flour again.  
Fry in pan or deep fryer at 350 for 8-12 minutes, until brown and crispy,  I usually do it 8 minutes.
