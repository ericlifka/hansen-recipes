Rueben Sandwiches

rye bread
Russian dressing
1 lb. Swiss or provolone
1 lb. corned beef
sauerkraut, drained
butter 

Spread butter on rye bread.
Top with corned beef, sauerkraut, and cheese.
Spread with Russian dressing.
I put it in the oven at 350 or 400 until the cheese melts (about 5-10 minutes).
You can also make the sandwich and wrap in foil and heat until cheese is melted or you can grill it.
