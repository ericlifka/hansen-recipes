Grilled Chicken Fingers

2 lbs.. chicken tenders
3 T. honey
3 T. lemon juice
1 1/2 t. ketchup
1/4 t. cumin
1 t. salt

In dish combine honey, lemon juice, ketchup, salt, and cumin.
I generally double the amount of marinade.
Put chicken in zip lock bag and pour marinade over.
Toss to coat.
Marinade in refrigerator at least one hour, up to 8 hours (I also do it overnight sometimes).
 Drain chicken and discard marinade.
I usually cook it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes, or you can grill them.
