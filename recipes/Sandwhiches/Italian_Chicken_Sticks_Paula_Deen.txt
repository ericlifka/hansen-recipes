Italian Chicken Sticks (Paula Deen)
1 c. seasoned bread crumbs1/2 c. Parmesan1 1/2 t.  each of thyme and basil
1 t. oregano1/2 t. each salt and garlic powderpinch ground red pepper
8 boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1/2 inch strips1/2 c. melted butter
Heat oven to 400.  In a pie plate combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan, thyme, basil, 
oregano, salt, garlic powder and red pepper.  Dip the chicken strips in the melted butter, 
then dredge them in the bread crumb mix.  Place the chicken strips in a single layer on a 
greased baking sheet.  Bake for 20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.  Can be 
served with marinara sauce or honey mustard.  I cut the pieces into 1/2 x 1/2 pieces as they 
crisp better.  I also turn them over when they are half finished.  If the pieces are bigger it 
may take 10 minutes more.
