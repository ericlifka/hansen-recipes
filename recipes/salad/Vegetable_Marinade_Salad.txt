Vegetable Marinade Salad

1 onion, diced
1-2 carrots, thinly sliced
3 c. broccoli florets
1 green pepper, chopped
3 stalks celery
1 small head cauliflower in pieces (night before)
20 mushrooms, sliced
Dressing:
1 c. sugar
2 t. dry mustard
1 t. salt
1/2 c. apple cider vinegar
1 1/2 c. salad oil

Mix dressing ingredients well.
Put all the vegetables into a large bowl except for the mushrooms which are added the next  day.
Pour the dressing over the vegetables and refrigerate overnight.
In the morning it will seem more watery and thatâ€™s how it should be.
Add the mushrooms and remix.
