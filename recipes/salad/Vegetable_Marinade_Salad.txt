Vegetable Marinade Salad
1 onion, diced1-2 carrots, thinly sliced3 c. broccoli florets1 green pepper, 
chopped3 stalks celery1 small head cauliflower in pieces (night before)
20 mushrooms, slicedDressing:  1 c. sugar2 t. dry mustard1 t. salt
1/2 c. apple cider vinegar1 1/2 c. salad oil
Mix dressing ingredients well.  Put all the vegetables into a large bowl  except for the 
mushrooms which are added the next  day.  Pour the dressing over the vegetables and 
refrigerate overnight.  In the morning it will seem more watery and thatâ€™s how it should be.  
Add the mushrooms and remix.
