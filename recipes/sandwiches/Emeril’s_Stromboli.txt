Emerilâ€™s Stromboli
1/2 lb. hot Italian sausage, removed from casing and crumbled1 c. onions
1/2 c. thin sliced red and green peppers2 T. jalapenos2 T. garlic
1 t. Italian seasoning1/2 lb. ham1/4 c. pepperoni or salami1/2 c. black olives
2 c. provolone2 c. mozzarella      1 egg beaten with 1 T. water1 c. Parmesan
In a skillet cook the sausage over medium high heat until browned and the fat is rendered, 
about 5 minutes.  Remove and drain.  Discard all but 1 T. fat from pan.  Add the onions, bell 
peppers, and jalapenos and cook, stirring until very soft 4-5 minutes.  Add the garlic and 
Italian seasoning and cook, stirring for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and cool.  Make a pizza 
dough (or buy) or use frozen, thawed bread.  Roll dough out to 10 x 14 inches.  
Overlapping slightly, layer half of the ham, pepperoni, olives, provolone and mozzarella 
over the top.  Using a pastry brush, paint the border of 1 long edge with egg wash.  
Starting at the opposite long end without egg wash, roll up the dough into a cylinder, 
pinching the edges to seal.  Place on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining 
ingredients.  Let dough rise 20-30 minutes.  Brush top of each with egg wash.  Bake until 
golden brown and crisp about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with Parmesan and cook until cheese is 
melted about 5 minutes.  Emeril made his own dough, but you can do your own thing.
