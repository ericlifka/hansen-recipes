Sausage, Pepper and Onion Burgers (Rachael Ray)
3/4 lb. hamburger3/4 lb. ground pork1/2 T. fennel seeds        6 cloves garlic,  minced
1/4 c. flat leaf parsley leaves, chopped1 to 1 1/2 t. crushed red pepper flakes
2 handfuls grated Parmigiano Reggiano1 T. grill seasoning (Montreal Steak Seasoning)
3 T. olive oil    2 large onions, thickly sliced1 red and 1 green pepper, seeded and
thickly sliced2 large or 4 small Cubanelle peppers, seeded and thinly sliced
salt and pepper4 Kaiser rollsprovolone cheese
In a bowl, combine the ground beef and pork with the fennel seeds, garlic, parsley, crushed 
red pepper flakes, Parmigiano, grill seasoning and  T. of olive oil.   Mix all together well and 
make your burgers about 1” thick.  Drizzle them with olive oil, cook on the grill about 6-8 
minutes per side.  Rachael made four burgers, but I used 1 lb. of both meats and made 9 
burgers.  Place a large sauté pan over medium high heat, add 2 T. olive oil.  Add the 
onions, and bell and Cubanelle peppers and season with salt and pepper.  Cook stirring 
occasionally until the onions and peppers are tender, about 8-10 minutes.  Split the rolls 
and toast briefly on the grill, until just marked.  Place a patty on a roll, top with 2 slices of 
cheese and the onion pepper mix.  I used 1 red, green, cubanelle, and onion.  I also put 
the pepper mix on the bottom, topped with a burger, and then top with cheese.  Dad and 
Steven liked these better than plain hamburgers.
