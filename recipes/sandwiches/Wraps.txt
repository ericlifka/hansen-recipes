Sauce:  I use a couple different ones--I frequently spread garden vegetable cream cheese 
on tortilla and top with stuff.  Another way is spread mayo  on tortilla and then top with salsa 
and top with stuff.  Another one is mix 8 oz. cr. cheese with Ranch dressing, top with stuff.
To fold, fold right and left edges to center over filling, fold bottom toward center and roll until 
completely wrapped.  (See tortilla wrapper).  I generally fold up the bottom and top, fold 
one side over and roll up (because I always overfill it).   Also, I wrap in saran wrap and then 
refrigerate until I need it.  If you like it warm heat at 400 for 12-15 minutes.
