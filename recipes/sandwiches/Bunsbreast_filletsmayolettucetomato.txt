Bunsbreast filletsmayolettucetomato
I take a breast and beat to about 1/4-1/2” thickness.  I cut each breast to a size that will fit a 
bun.  Coat breast in flour, then pepper sauce, then in flour again.  Fry in pan or deep fryer at 
350 for 8-12 minutes, until brown and crispy,  I usually do it 8 minutes.
