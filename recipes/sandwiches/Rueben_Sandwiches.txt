Rueben Sandwiches
rye breadRussian dressing1 lb. Swiss or provolone1 lb. corned beef

Spread butter  on rye bread.  Top with corned beef, sauerkraut, and cheese.  Spread with 
Russian dressing.  I put it in the oven at 350 or 400 until the cheese melts (about 5-10 
minutes).   You can also make the sandwich and wrap in foil and heat until cheese is melted 
or you can grill it.
