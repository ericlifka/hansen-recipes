Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich
The one I do for a group is italian or hoagie rolls, cheese whiz or provolone, deli roast beef, 
onions, green peppers, mushrooms (optional).  I put the roast beef on a bun, top with 
onions, green peppers, mushrooms which have been saut√©ed, top with cheese and bake 
at 400 for 5-10 minutes until cheese is melted.
