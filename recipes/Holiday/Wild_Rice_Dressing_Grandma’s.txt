Wild Rice Dressing (Grandma’s)
Soak 1 c. wild rice night before.  Buy 1 lb. gizzards.  Cook gizzards and neck, etc. from the 
fowl for 2 hours covered in water and these things:  1 onion chopped up (not diced), 4 
cloves  chopped garlic, 1 tsp. thyme, 1 tsp. sage, 1 tablespoon oregano leaves, 1/2 tsp. 
salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. garlic salt.  Drain off liquid and save.  Cut up gizzards into tiny 
pieces and refrigerate until putting dressing together.  Put 3 c. of saved liquid into pot with 
drained rice.  Cook 45 minutes.  While rice is cooking, sauté 1 huge onion diced, 4 cloves 
garlic chopped, 1 lb. mushrooms cut up.  Cook each separately in  butter.  Do the garlic first, 
then add onions.  Put into dish and use same pan to do mushrooms.  Don’t be stingy with 
butter.  Throw rice, onions, garlic, mushrooms, gizzards together.  It can be served right 
away or reheated later.  You can also add pork sausage.  You can half this recipe.
