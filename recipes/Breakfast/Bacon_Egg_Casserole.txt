Bacon Egg Casserole
3 medium potatoes, peeled and diced   1/4 c. butter  1/4 c. flour1 c. milk

12 eggs, scrambled until lightly set1 lb. bacon, cooked and crumbled

Sauté potatoes in a little bit of the bacon grease for 5 minutes.  Melt 1/4 c. butter in pan 
over medium heat, add flour and stir until smooth.  Cook 1 minutes, stirring constantly.  
Gradually add milk and half and half; cover over medium heat stirring constantly until 
thickened and bubbly.  Add cheese, italian seasonings, and pepper stirring constantly until 
cheese melts.  Remove from heat.  Layer half each of eggs, bacon and cheese sauce in 
greased 9 x 13” pan (I use a casserole dish).  Top with potatoes.  Top with remaining 
eggs, bacon and cheese sauce.  Combine bread crumbs and 3 T. butter.  Sprinkle over 
casserole.  Cover and chill overnight, if desired.  Remove from fridge and let stand at room 
temp for 30 min.  Bake uncovered at 350 for 30 minutes or until heated.
