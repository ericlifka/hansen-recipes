Bacon Chicken Roll ups
12 bacon strips6 4 oz. chicken breasts8 oz. cr. cheese1 sweet onion sliced
Cook bacon until cooked but not crisp.  Remove to paper towels.  Flatten chicken to 1/8 in 
thickness.  Spread cr. cheese down the center of each breast.  Top with onion.  Roll up from 
a long side; tuck ends in.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Wrap 2 bacon strips around each 
piece of chicken; secure with toothpicks.  Place in greased pan and bake at 350 for 35-40 
minutes.  When I did this I would undercook the bacon because it was overcooked.
