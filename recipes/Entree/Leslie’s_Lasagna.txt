8 oz. lasagna noodlesonion and garlic powder is to your taste
Brown meat in veggie oil.  Spoon off fat.  Add garlic powder, basil, salt, stewed tomatoes,
tomato paste, tomato sauce, oregano and heat to simmering level.  Spoon some of the hot 
sauce and beat together with eggs.  Pour back into the sauce and add pepper and onion.  
Simmer for 30 minutes.  Cook noodles.  Grease a cake pan.  Spoon in enough meat sauce 
to cover bottom.  Then put in layers of lasagna, ricotta, mozzarella and meat sauce until you 
run out of layers.  The last two layers should be noodles with meat sauce spooned into 
centers of each strip.  There is enough cheese for 2 layers.  Top entire thing with parmesan.  
Bake uncovered at 350 for 30 minutes.  I make this and refrigerate and bring to room temp 
and then bake at 350 for 1 hour.
