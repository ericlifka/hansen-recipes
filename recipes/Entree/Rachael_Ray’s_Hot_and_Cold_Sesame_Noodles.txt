Cook pasta to al dente, with a bite to it, then shock it to stop the cooking process by running 
it under cold water in colander.  Drain the pasta well.  In the bottom of a large bowl, whisk 
together soy, peanut butter, vinegar, oil, sesame oil, and hot sauce.   Add noodles and 
veggies and toss to combine the noodles and coat them evenly with sauce.  Sprinkle 
green onions and sesame seeds throughout and serve.
