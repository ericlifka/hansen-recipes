Ruby Tuesday  Sonora Chicken Pasta

1 lb. velveeta or 1 16 oz. jar cheese whiz
1/2 c. heavy cream
2 T. minced red chili pepper
4 T. green chili pepper, minced
4 T. onion
1 garlic
2 t. olive oil
2 T. water
1/2 t. salt
2 t. sugar
1/2 T. vinegar
1/4 t. cumin     
16 oz. penne pasta
dash paprika      
4 chicken breast halves          
1 15 oz. can black beans, undrained
2  Roma tomatoes
2-4 green onions, chopped

Preheat your stovetop grill.
Combine the cheese with the cream in a small saucepan over low heat.
Stir often until it melts and is smooth.
Sauté the red chili peppers and 2 T. green chili pepper, 2 T. onion and 1/2 clove garlic in olive oil for a couple minutes then add the water to the pan so that the peppers don’t scorch.
Simmer another 2 minutes or until water has cooked off.
When the cheese is smooth, add peppers, 1/4 t. salt, sugar, vinegar, and cumin.
Leave on low heat, stirring occasionally until other ingredients are ready.
Pour can of beans with  liquid into small pan over medium heat.
Add remaining green chili pepper, onions, garlic, pinch salt, dash paprika.
Bring beans to a boil, stirring often, then simmer until everything else is ready.
By this time the beans will have thickened and the onions will be transparent.
Rub breasts with oil and salt and pepper.
Cook on grill for 5 minutes per side or until done.
When done, slice each breast into slices.
As the chicken cooks prepare the pasta.
Cook 12-14 minutes or until tender.
Drain.
When all is ready spoon pasta onto each plate, pour some cheese sauce over, add sliced breast, top with 1/3 c. black beans, sprinkle 1/4 c. tomato and some green onions over.
I have revised this as it’s too putsy for serving.
I slice the chicken into cubes and cook and add to the cheese mix.
I add the cooked beans to the cheese and add the tomato.
I just let folks dish their own pasta/sauce.
