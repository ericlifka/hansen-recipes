Chilaquiles
1 T. canola oil    1 lb. ground turkey2 red onions     4 cloves garlic1/4 t. cumin
1 1/2 t. chili powder   4 oz. can diced green chilies, not drained     1 t. pepper, salt
15 oz. can tomatoes with with green chilies, not drained    2 c. cheddar
1 8 oz light cream cheese8 oz. sour cream8 (6”) tortillas1 bunch green onions
1/4 c. low fat mozzarella cheese
Heat oven to 350.  Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat.  Add 1 T. canola oil 
to coat bottom of the pot.  Add the ground turkey to the hot oil and brown, breaking it up as 
it cooks.  Drain meat.  To the same skillet which has a little residual fat from cooking the 
turkey, add the onions and cook over medium heat until soft; then add the garlic and cook 
until soft.  Stir in the chili powder and cumin.  Add the chilies and their juices and the 
tomatoes and their juices.  Add the meat back to the pan and stir until combined.  Reduce 
heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes or until thick.  Season with salt and pepper.  In a 
medium bowl combine cheddar, cream cheese and sour cream; set aside.  In a casserole 
dish line with half the tortillas and ladle half of the meat mix over.  Cover with half of the 
cheese mix (spread).  Top with half of the green onions.  Repeat layers 1 more time but 
leave off the rest of the green onions until later.  Bake for 45 minutes or until bubbling.  Top 
with green onions and mozzarella.  Cook a few more minutes.  Can skip the mozzarella--I 
didn’t have any the first time I made it, and it was fine.
