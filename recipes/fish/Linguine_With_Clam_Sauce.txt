Linguine With Clam Sauce
5 cloves garlic1/4 c. olive oil3 cans clams (save broth)1/2 c. white wine
1/2-3/4 c. broth1/2 c. parsley        1 t. basil, oregano, pepper    linguine
Heat oil (may use less oil) and add garlic and saut√©.  Add clams without broth and cook 3-4 
minutes.  Add rest of stuff, simmer 15-20 minutes or until desired thickness.  The more broth 
and liquid you add the longer you need to simmer.  I also add some half and half if I want it 
to be more of a white sauce.
