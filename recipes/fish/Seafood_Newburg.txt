To make the sauce, combine flour, paprika, curry, nutmeg, cayenne, salt to taste in a small 
bowl and set aside.  Melt butter over low heat.  Add shallot and cook 3 minutes.  Simmer 
milk and tomato paste in a separate pan.  Add flour mix to the shallot and stir until mixed 
well with the butter.  Add sherry and whisk until smooth add the milk mix to the flour mix, 
whisking constantly until creamy and thick.  While you are doing this boil water, salt, bay 
leaves and peppercorns add scallops and boil 3 minutes.  Remove and set aside.  Do the 
same with shrimp and lobster tail meat.  I cut up the lobster tail in chunks.  Add the shell fish
