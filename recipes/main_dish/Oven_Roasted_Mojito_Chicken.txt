Oven Roasted Mojito Chicken
1 chicken (3 1/2 lb.) cut into 8 pieces1 c. mojito marinade2 T. italian parsley
1 large onion, sliced  1/2‚Äù round
Marinade meat in 1 c. mojito marinade 4 hours or overnight.  Scatter onions slices on bottom 
of a pan.  Heat oven to 375.  Put chicken on top, pour remaining marinade over chicken and 
onions, roast 1 hour and 15 minutes, till chicken is golden and cooked through.  Mojito 
marinade:  1/4 c. garlic, 1/2 c. onion, 2 c. orange juice, 1/2 c. lime juice, 1/2 c. olive oil, 4 t. 
salt, 1 T. pepper, 2 t. cumin, 2 t. oregano,  1 T. cilantro.  Mix together garlic, onions, orange 
juice, and lime juice in a bowl.  Heat the olive oil in a pan, add orange juice mix and simmer 
for 5-10 minutes to soften the onions and garlic.  Season the marinade with the rest of the 
ingredients.  Pour everything in a blender and pulse to combine.  Pour into container and 
cool to room temp; then cover and refrigerate.  Keeps for us to 2 weeks.  I would do it this 
way because when we initially did it it was messy and dangerous as they put all into a 
smoking pan which could burn you.
