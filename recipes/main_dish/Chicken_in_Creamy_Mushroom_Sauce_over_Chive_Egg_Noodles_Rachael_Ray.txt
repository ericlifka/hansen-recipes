water to a boil.  Cook egg noodles according to package directions.  Season with salt and 
pepper, toss to coat.  While the water is coming to a boil, start the mushrooms.  Place a 
large skillet over medium high heat with 2 T. of butter and 2 T. olive oil.  Add the shallots 
and cook stirring frequently for 2-3 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and continue to cook for 4-
5 more minutes until they are tender and barely golden in color.  Season the mushrooms 
with salt, pepper and thyme.  Add the flour and continue to cook for 1 minute, whisk in the 
white wine, then the chicken poaching liquid (adding slowly so doesnâ€™t get too thin) and the 
cream.  Season with a little nutmeg and bring up to a simmer.  Slice 4 of the poached 
chicken breasts on an angle and put into the creamy mushroom sauce and simmer until the 
chicken is heated through again.  Add more of the poaching liquid if the sauce is too thick.  
Serve noodles topped with sliced chicken breast and creamy mushroom sauce.
