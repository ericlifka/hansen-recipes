Karen’s Stuffed Breasts
3 T. butter2 leeks, cut into 2” pieces2/3 c. plus 3 T. whip cream    salt and pepper
4 boneless breasts1 c. chicken stock8 oz. fresh mushrooms1 c. wine
2 T. flourbread crumbs
Melt butter.  Add leeks and cook until almost soft, about 5 minutes.  Add 3 T. cream, salt 
and pepper.  Cook until  leeks are soft and liquid evaporates, about 15 minutes.  Cook 
mushrooms down and drain.  Pound the breast to 1/4” or so.  Spread 1 T. leek mix over 
breasts.  Roll up tightly and tie with a string.   Dredge breasts in bread crumbs.  Bake at 
350 for 30 minutes.  Prepare sauce:  Mix flour, 2/3 c. cream, chicken stock, wine, 
mushrooms, and any leek leftovers.  Cook until as thick as you want.  (This is not as thick as 
gravy, but you can make it thicker by using more flour.)  To serve, put 1 T. sauce on plate; 
top with breast and spoon sauce over.
Can also do slightly different--I have done it the same up to the string part and then instead 
of dredging in crumbs brush chicken with oil.  Put chicken in ovenproof skillet.  Bake for 25 
minutes.  Transfer to platter.  Cut strings and remove.  Sauce can be 2/3 c. cream, chicken 
stock and leek leftovers in same pan.  Boil until reduced to 2/3 c. about 5 minutes.  Stir in 
1/4 c. toasted walnuts.  Put 1 T. sauce on plate, cut each breast into 5 slices.  Put slices on 
sauce and spoon sauce over.
