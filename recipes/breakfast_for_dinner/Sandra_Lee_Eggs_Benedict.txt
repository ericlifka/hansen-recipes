Sandra Lee Eggs Benedict
4 6 oz. prepackaged croissants, toasted or warmed in oven1 t. white vinegar
6 large eggs1 pkg. dry hollandaise sauce mix1 1/4 c. milk1 T. fresh chives, chopped
1 T. tarragon leaves, chopped4 slices proscuitto, thinly sliced
Preheat oven to 325.  Slice croissants horizontally and place all 4 on baking sheet.  Fill a 
medium sized frying pan halfway with water.  Over medium heat bring water to a simmer.  
Add white vinegar to water.  Do not let water boil.  Working with 1 egg at a time, crack egg 
into a small bowl and slide into simmering water.  Simmer eggs 3-5 minutes, or until whites 
are cooked and yolk is still soft.  Transfer eggs with slotted spoon onto a plate.  Eggs can 
be precooked and refrigerated at this point.  Reheat by sliding egg into simmering water for 
1 minute at time of service.  In a small saucepan, add hollandaise packet to the milk.  Add 
the chives and tarragon.  Heat thoroughly over low heat, stirring constantly.  Remove from 
heat, set aside.  Separate croissant halves and place together forming a circle, cut side up.  
Top each half with prosciutto and a poached egg.  Spoon hollandaise sauce over the top of 
the egg.  Serve.
