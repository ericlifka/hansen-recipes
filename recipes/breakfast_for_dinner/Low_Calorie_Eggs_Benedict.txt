Low Calorie Eggs Benedict
8 slices multi-grain bread8 slices canadian bacon8 poached eggs
1 t. canola oil1 c. diced sweet onion10 oz. thawed chopped spinach
1 lemon, zested juiced8 oz. light sour cream1/2 t. hot sauce1 t. salt
1/2 t. pepper1 T. cider vinegar
Using a big cookie cuter, cut a disk out of each slice of bread.  Set aside.  In  skillet heat oil 
over medium heat.  Add onions and saut√© until translucent.  Add spinach, lemon zest and 
juice and continue cooking over medium heat for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and transfer 
mix to food processor.  Add sour cream and blend until creamy, add hot sauce and then 
season to taste with salt and pepper.  Fill a 12 inch skillet with 2 inches of water.  Add 
vinegar and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat until the bubbles just stop.  Crack each egg 
into the water and simmer until whites are set and opaque in color, 2-3 minutes.  While eggs 
poach, toast bread.  Cook bacon until warmed through.  Remove eggs from water and blot 
on towel to remove moisture.  To assemble lay 2 slices bacon on 2 toast rounds.  Top with 
1/4 of the spinach and finish with 2 eggs on top.  When I did this, I used English muffins and 
I did not use light sour cream because I have noticed that it tends to turn to water.
