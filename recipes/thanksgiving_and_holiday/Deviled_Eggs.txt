Deviled Eggs
Put eggs in pan.  Boil 2 minutes.  Remove from heat, place cover on pan.  Let stand 17 
minutes.  Drain.  I slice in half.  Mash the egg yolks, add tablespoon of salad dressing,  salt 
and pepper, and some relish, dot of mustard.  Grandma Hansen uses: 1 T. mustard, 1 or 
more T. sweet relish, 1 T. sugar, 1 T. vinegar, 2 whopping T. miracle whip, salt and pepper.
Fill eggs with stuff.  Refrigerate.
