Beef Enchiladas

1 1/2 lb. hamburger
onion
2-3 cans enchilada sauce
8 oz. tomato sauce
tortillas
cheese
green onions

Brown hamburger, drain.
Add onion.
Add 1 can enchilada sauce and cook until onion is done and meat mix is hot.
Take off heat.
Microwave tortillas  (10 second/tortilla or 2 minutes/bag).
Put some meat mix on center of each tortilla, top with cheese and roll up.
I mix 1 can enchilada sauce with tomato sauce so it is not as spicy.
Put some on bottom of 9 x 13 so that tortillas donâ€™t stick.
Put tortillas in.
Top with rest of sauce.
Bake for 25-30 minutes at 350.
Top with cheese and green onions and cook until cheese is melted.
