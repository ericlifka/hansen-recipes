Chef Jack’s Corn Chowder
1 c. butter1 onion, diced1 carrot, diced1 celery stalk, diced
1 clove garlic, minced1/2 c. flour3 c. corn kernels, fresh or frozen 
3 c. chicken stock        2 c. half and half
Melt 1 stick butter in pan over medium heat.  Add onion, carrot, celery and garlic and sauté 
for 2 minutes.  Add the flour and stir to make a roux.  Cook until the roux is lightly browned, 
set aside to cool.   Meanwhile, combine corn and stock in another pan and bring to a boil.  
Simmer for 10 minutes.  Pour the boiling stock with the corn (a little at a time) into the pan 
with the roux, whisking briskly so it doesn’t lump.  Return the skillet to the heat and bring to a 
boil.  The mix should become thick.  Add half and half into the corn mix.  Just before 
serving, cut the remaining stick of butter into chunks and add to soup.  I generally don’t add 
the other stick of butter  because of all the fat.  I also frequently save left over corn from 
dinners in a baggie and freeze and use that for the corn.
