Down Home Split Pea Soup
1 lb. dry split green peas1 1/2 qt. chicken broth2 large smoked ham hocks
2 c. milk1 large onion, chopped1 large potato, peeled and diced2 bay leaves
1-2 T. fresh dill3 dashes of hot pepper saucepepper
Rinse the split peas and combine them with all the remaining ingredients in a large pot.  
Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat and bring the liquid just to a 
simmer.  Cover and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  Remove the cover and cook for 
an additional 1/2 hour.  Remove the ham hocks.  Slice the meat off the bones and cut into 
bite size pieces.  Discard the fat, bones, and bay leaves.  Return the meat to the pot and 
cook 1/2 hour longer.  I usually make this with a ham bone and add leftover ham.
