Paula Deen’s Artichoke Dip
2 cans artichoke hearts1 pkg. spinach, thawed and squeezed1/2 c. mayo
1/2 c. sour cream1 c. ParmesanPepper jack cheese (about 1/2-1 c.)
Pulse the hearts in food processor.  Add rest of ingredients and bake at 350 or 30 minutes.  
I generally use 1 can of hearts and half a pkg. of spinach since some of you don’t like 
spinach much.  I also tend to use 3/4 c. parmesan and 1 c. pepper jack.
